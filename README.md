# sql-challenge
A database made with employee information in mind from the 1990's and 1980's(those eras had better music compared to today).
employees were queried through various conditions(i.e age, sex, year they are hired, etc).
In a nutshell, the HW asks to query "who", "what", and "when" during the 20th century
